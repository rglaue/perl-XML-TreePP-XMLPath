Revision history for Perl module XML::TreePP::XMLPath.

0.55    2009-08-10 reg
        - This is a rerelease of 0.54 for CPAN. There are no modifications.

0.54    2009-08-10 reg
        - There was a conflict in the documentation as to the true name of the
          getValue() method. However, I like getValues() better as the method
          name. So the function getValue() changed names to getValues().
        - This update was released on the same day as 0.53

0.53    2009-08-10 reg
        - The author has decided to attempt some level of XPath compatibility.
        - Added new method getValue() to retrieve values from an XML Document
          as derived from the given XMLPath.
        - Changed warning implementation to carp
        - Added Data::Dump dependency in Makefile.PL. This dependency was
          introduced in version 0.52, but failed to be added as a dependency
          in the Makefile.PL. This resulted in test and runtime errors if that
          module did not exist on the system.

0.52    2009-05-12 reg
        - Removed dependency on Params::Validate
        - Updated documentation with corrections
        - Expanded the fundamental filter support recognized by XMLPath
          philosophy. Additional filtering now includes:
          + attribute/element existence testing : /books/book[@author]
          + accessing items with positional a argument : /books/book[3]
          + access the current context with '.' : 
            /path/node[.="CDATAvalue"] -sameas-> /path[node="CDATAvalue"]/node
            or /path/node/.[@attr="val"] -sameas-> /path/node[@attr="val"]
        - Expanded parseXMLPath() to support the new XMLPath filter options
        - Added filterXMLDoc() method
          + replaces getSubtree() and validateAttrValue() methods
          + implements the new XMLPath filter options
        - Deprecated getSubtree() and validateAttrValue() methods
        - Added get() and set() methods to support passing in properties that
          should be used when this module loads XML::TreePP (ie 'attr_prefix')
        - Added tpp() accessor method to access the loaded instance of
          XML::TreePP, or to load an instance for this module to use.

0.51    2008-11-10 reg
        - Added Params::Validate dependency to Makefile to allow for
          successful building

0.50	2008-11-03 reg

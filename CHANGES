Revision history for Perl module XML::TreePP::XMLPath.

0.72    2013-05-31 reg
        - Fixed documentation that discusses the internal loading and use of
          an XML::TreePP object. This helps to bring documentation in line
          with the POD documentation of XML::TreePP::Editor.
        - The new() method can now accept an argument that allows the caller
          to provide an XML::TreePP object. This allows one call
          $tppx = new XML::TreePP::XMLPath( tpp => $tpp_obj );
          instead of requiring two calls
          $tppx = new XML::TreePP::XMLPath; $tppx->tpp( $tpp_obj );

0.71    2013-05-30 reg
        - Getter and setter methods were not properly accessing the properties
          of XML::TreePP. XML::TreePP::XMLPath was only accessing them directly
          through the internally referenced XML::TreePP object's getter and
          setter. As a result. this feature was removed, and documentation was
          updated to reflect that the XML::TreePP properties must be set and
          retrieved through the object's internally referenced XML::TreePP
          object via XML::TreePP::XMLPath->tpp()->set|get(...) in OO mode.

0.70    2013-04-16 reg
        - Bug fix for the issue where $tpp->parse($x) dies when $x is not
          defined, whereas the code was instead expecting undef to be returned
          in this case. This bug caused calls to filterXMLDoc() or getValues()
          to fail when the XMLPath referenced a non-existing XML leaf. 
        - Bug fix to an issue in the charlexslit method of recognizing strings
          with an escape character. Previously no escape character was used, and
          strings escaping a character that was also the stop or start token
          would fail to be recognized properly. Example as in 'The Cat\'s Meow'
          would attempt to extract the string q{The Cat\} and would fail because
          the it does cannot handle the remaining dangling string q{s Meow}.
        - No longer has dependency on Data::Dump, and all use has been changed
          to the Data::Dumper module. This change includes use of the method in
          the examples of the documentation.
        - New function assembleXMLPath() for assembling an XMLPath from a
          provided representative array or hash ref structure.
        - The deprecated methods validateAttrValue and getSubtree are now only
          wrappers around the filterXMLDoc method. If they are called, a carp
          message is given stating their deprecation. Also, their related
          documentation has been removed. This allows for backwards
          compatibility without encouraging new use.

0.63    2011-01-17 reg
        - This fixes a bug in getValues() method exposed in PERL 5.13.1 and
          higher, where a local variable is not shared with a sub reference.
        - Replaced the use of the Data::Dump module with Data::Dumper.
          In the latest version of PERL (5.12.2 tested) the eval function does
          not like unquoted HASH keys which begin with the dash "-". Data::Dump
          does not quote the hash key, so its use was replaced with
          Data::Dumper which does quote the hash key. It is used to clone XML
          structures.
          The XML::TreePP module uses the dash "-" as default (configurable to
          optionally use "@" instead of "-") to indicate attributes of XML
          elements. So the XML string "<element attribute="value"/>" is
          represented in PERL structure as
                 "{ element => { -attribute => 'value' } }" with Data::Dump
          and as "{ element => { '-attribute' => 'value' } }" with Data::Dumper

0.62    2010-02-04 reg
        - This fixes a bug for getValues() method. This method would not return
          the value of an attribute if the values was "0" (zero).
        - The getValues() test case was modified to test for this.

0.61    2009-11-04 reg
        - Bug fix for issue when filtering for the root element (i.e. '/root')
          filterXMLDoc returned a hash as a result rather than an ARRAY ref.

0.60    2009-10-07 reg
        - Major changes to internal functionality of the filterXMLDoc() method,
          which includes a new mapping option (structure => type) to define the
          the format of the returned results.
        - The filterXMLDoc() method now has good support for use of the special
          parent (..) indication in an XMLPath.
        - Updated POD documentation.
        - Some code cleanup.

0.56    2009-09-08 reg
        - This fixes a bug for getElements and getAttributes methods. These
          methods were only returning values for the first found node instead of
          all found nodes. The fix was to change these methods to use the
          filterXMLDoc method, instead of the deprecated getSubtree method.
        - New test cases added to test the aformentioned scenario.
        - The helper script 'runtests.pl' was added to allow for manually
          executing all test cases at once.
        - Documentation added to README and POD to describe how to use this
          module with a generic (non-XML) PERL code reference tree.

0.55    2009-08-10 reg
        - This is a rerelease of 0.54 for CPAN. There are no modifications.

0.54    2009-08-10 reg
        - There was a conflict in the documentation as to the true name of the
          getValue() method. However, I like getValues() better as the method
          name. So the function getValue() changed names to getValues().
        - This update was released on the same day as 0.53

0.53    2009-08-10 reg
        - The author has decided to attempt some level of XPath compatibility.
        - Added new method getValue() to retrieve values from an XML Document
          as derived from the given XMLPath.
        - Changed warning implementation to carp
        - Added Data::Dump dependency in Makefile.PL. This dependency was
          introduced in version 0.52, but failed to be added as a dependency
          in the Makefile.PL. This resulted in test and runtime errors if that
          module did not exist on the system.

0.52    2009-05-12 reg
        - Removed dependency on Params::Validate
        - Updated documentation with corrections
        - Expanded the fundamental filter support recognized by XMLPath
          philosophy. Additional filtering now includes:
          + attribute/element existence testing : /books/book[@author]
          + accessing items with positional a argument : /books/book[3]
          + access the current context with '.' : 
            /path/node[.="CDATAvalue"] -sameas-> /path[node="CDATAvalue"]/node
            or /path/node/.[@attr="val"] -sameas-> /path/node[@attr="val"]
        - Expanded parseXMLPath() to support the new XMLPath filter options
        - Added filterXMLDoc() method
          + replaces getSubtree() and validateAttrValue() methods
          + implements the new XMLPath filter options
        - Deprecated getSubtree() and validateAttrValue() methods
        - Added get() and set() methods to support passing in properties that
          should be used when this module loads XML::TreePP (ie 'attr_prefix')
        - Added tpp() accessor method to access the loaded instance of
          XML::TreePP, or to load an instance for this module to use.

0.51    2008-11-10 reg
        - Added Params::Validate dependency to Makefile to allow for
          successful building

0.50	2008-11-03 reg
